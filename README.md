# Twitter-client-for-Discord
This is a Twitter client allowing you to post tweets from inside a Discord server
This Twitter/Discord client is not secure and was not originally designed for public use. As such, if anything goes wrong it is on you.
Use "./install.sh" to install all the required conponents and "./start.sh" to run. You must already have Javascript and NPM installed. This is made for Linux, though it may run on Windows or Mac with some slight changes.
